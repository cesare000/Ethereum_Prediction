# Ethereum_Prediction
!!!!! DO NOT TRUST INVEST MONEY BASED ON THIS, I'VE MADE IT JUST FOR FUN AND IT IS NOT SECURE AT ALL. THIS WAS NOT MADE IN ORDER TO BE A FINANCIAL ADVICE !!!!!
Since I'm quite a beginner in data science, I've followed the guide in the following article: https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/ethereum-price-prediction-with-python-3b3805e6e512

I've made annotations in order to understand the code and learn the most possible out of this coding project (unfortunately the comments are in italian :))

In order to run this properly you should:
  1. Have anaconda navigator and run it with Jupyter Notebooks
  2. Run it from the beginning to the end, or the variables/imported modules won't be registered (it's only a few clicks)
